# Custom ViewPager2

This folder contains a customized version of the `androidx.viewpager2` library. The original source
code was downloaded from the official AndroidX repository and modifications were made to address
`EditText` focus-related issue. (See #17)

## Changes Made

The `EditText` focus issue encountered in the original library has been resolved through
modification in `ScrollEventAdapter` class. The `dispatchSelected` method is fully commented out,
which somehow solves the problem ðŸ¤¯

modifications made to this customized version are also provided under the same license.
